Viamala is a bottle / waitress based webserver intended for the LAN that allows users to have their video files cut. This happens in a very simple manner with ffmpeg without reencoding.

Works well with [surselva](https://github.com/krateng/surselva).

## Requirements

* [bottle.py](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)
* [waitress](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress)
* [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
